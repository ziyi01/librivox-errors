eight years before he had seen his friend off at the north wall and wished him godspeed gallaher had got on you could tell that at once by his travelled air his well-cut tweed suit and fearless accent few fellows had talents like his and fewer still could remain unspoiled by such success gallaher's heart was in the right place and he had deserved to win it was something to have a friend like that little chandler's thoughts ever since lunch-time had been of his meeting with gallaher of gallaher's invitation and of the great city london where gallaher lived he was called little chandler because though he was but slightly under the average stature he gave one the idea of being a little man his hands were white and small his frame was fragile his voice was quiet and his manners were refined he took the greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief the half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish white teeth as he sat at his desk in the king's inns he thought what changes those eight years had brought the friend whom he had known under a shabby and necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the london press he turned often from his tiresome writing to gaze out of the office window the glow of a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and walks it cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on the benches it flickered upon all the moving figures on the children who ran screaming along the gravel paths and on everyone who passed through the gardens he watched the scene and thought of life and as always happened when he thought of life he became sad a gentle melancholy took possession of him he felt how useless it was to struggle against fortune this being the burden of wisdom which the ages had bequeathed to him he remembered the books of poetry upon his shelves at home he had bought them in his bachelor days and many an evening as he sat in the little room off the hall he had been tempted to take one down from the bookshelf and read out something to his wife but shyness had always held him back and so the books had remained on their shelves at times he repeated lines to himself and this consoled him when his hour had struck he stood up and took leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks punctiliously he emerged from under the feudal arch of the king's inns a neat modest figure and walked swiftly down henrietta street the golden sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp a horde of grimy children populated the street they stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon the thresholds little chandler gave them no thought he picked his way deftly through all that minute vermin-like life and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions in which the old nobility of dublin had roystered no memory of the past touched him for his mind was full of a present joy he had never been in corless's but he knew the value of the name he knew that people went there after the theatre to eat oysters and drink liqueurs and he had heard that the waiters there spoke french and german walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn up before the door and richly dressed ladies escorted by cavaliers alight and enter quickly they wore noisy dresses and many wraps their faces were powdered and they caught up their dresses when they touched earth like alarmed atalantas he had always passed without turning his head to look it was his habit to walk swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he found himself in the city late at night he hurried on his way apprehensively and excitedly sometimes however he courted the causes of his fear he chose the darkest and narrowest streets and as he walked boldly forward the silence that was spread about his footsteps troubled him the wandering silent figures troubled him and at times a sound of low fugitive laughter made him tremble like a leaf he turned to the right towards capel street ignatius gallaher on the london press who would have thought it possible eight years before still now that he reviewed the past little chandler could remember many signs of future greatness in his friend people used to say that ignatius gallaher was wild of course he did mix with a rakish set of fellows at that time drank freely and borrowed money on all sides in the end he had got mixed up in some shady affair some money transaction at least that was one version of his flight but nobody denied him talent there was always a certain something in ignatius gallaher that impressed you in spite of yourself even when he was out at elbows and at his wits end for money he kept up a bold face little chandler remembered and the remembrance brought a slight flush of pride to his cheek one of ignatius gallaher's sayings when he was in a tight corner half time now boys he used to say light-heartedly where's my considering cap that was ignatius gallaher all out and damn it you couldn't but admire him for it little chandler quickened his pace for the first time in his life he felt himself superior to the people he passed for the first time his soul revolted against the dull inelegance of capel street there was no doubt about it if you wanted to succeed you had to go away you could do nothing in dublin as he crossed grattan bridge he looked down the river towards the lower quays and pitied the poor stunted houses they seemed to him a band of tramps huddled together along the riverbanks their old coats covered with dust and soot stupefied by the panorama of sunset and waiting for the first chill of night bid them arise shake themselves and begone he wondered whether he could write a poem to express his idea perhaps gallaher might be able to get it into some london paper for him could he write something original he was not sure what idea he wished to express but the thought that a poetic moment had touched him took life within him like an infant hope he stepped onward bravely every step brought him nearer to london farther from his own sober inartistic life a light began to tremble on the horizon of his mind he was not so old thirty-two his temperament might be said to be just at the point of maturity there were so many different moods and impressions that he wished to express in verse he felt them within him he tried to weigh his soul to see if it was a poet's soul melancholy was the dominant note of his temperament he thought but it was a melancholy tempered by recurrences of faith and resignation and simple joy if he could give expression to it in a book of poems perhaps men would listen he would never be popular he saw that he could not sway the crowd but he might appeal to a little circle of kindred minds the english critics perhaps would recognise him as one of the celtic school by reason of the melancholy tone of his poems besides that he would put in allusions he began to invent sentences and phrases from the notice which his book would get mister chandler has the gift of easy and graceful verse a wistful sadness pervades these poems the celtic note it was a pity his name was not more irish-looking perhaps it would be better to insert his mother's name before the surname thomas malone chandler or better still t malone chandler he would speak to gallaher about it mister chandler has the gift of easy and graceful verse a wistful sadness pervades these poems the celtic note he pursued his revery so ardently that he passed his street and had to turn back as he came near corless's his former agitation began to overmaster him and he halted before the door in indecision finally he opened the door and entered the light and noise of the bar held him at the doorways for a few moments he looked about him but his sight was confused by the shining of many red and green wine-glasses the bar seemed to him to be full of people and he felt that the people were observing him curiously he glanced quickly to right and left frowning slightly to make his errand appear serious but when his sight cleared a little he saw that nobody had turned to look at him and there sure enough was ignatius gallaher leaning with his back against the counter and his feet planted far apart hallo tommy old hero here you are what is it to be what will you have i'm taking whisky better stuff than we get across the water soda lithia no mineral i'm the same spoils the flavour here garÃ§on bring us two halves of malt whisky like a good fellow well and how have you been pulling along since i saw you last dear god how old we're getting do you see any signs of aging in me eh what a little grey and thin on the top what garÃ§on ignatius gallaher took off his hat and displayed a large closely cropped head his face was heavy pale and clean-shaven his eyes which were of bluish slate-colour relieved his unhealthy pallor and shone out plainly above the vivid orange tie he wore between these rival features the lips appeared very long and shapeless and colourless he bent his head and felt with two sympathetic fingers the thin hair at the crown little chandler shook his head as a denial ignatius galaher put on his hat again it pulls you down he said press life always hurry and scurry looking for copy and sometimes not finding it and then always to have something new in your stuff damn proofs and printers i say for a few days i'm deuced glad i can tell you to get back to the old country does a fellow good a bit of a holiday i feel a ton better since i landed again in dear dirty dublin here you are tommy water say when little chandler allowed his whisky to be very much diluted you don't know what's good for you my boy said ignatius gallaher i drink mine neat i drink very little as a rule said little chandler modestly an odd half-one or so when i meet any of the old crowd that's all ah well said ignatius gallaher cheerfully here's to us and to old times and old acquaintance they clinked glasses and drank the toast i met some of the old gang today said ignatius gallaher o'hara seems to be in a bad way what's he doing nothing said little chandler he's gone to the dogs but hogan has a good sit hasn't he yes he's in the land commission i met him one night in london and he seemed to be very flush poor o'hara boose i suppose other things too said little chandler shortly ignatius gallaher laughed tommy he said i see you haven't changed an atom you're the very same serious person that used to lecture me on sunday mornings when i had a sore head and a fur on my tongue you'd want to knock about a bit in the world have you never been anywhere even for a trip i've been to the isle of man said little chandler ignatius gallaher laughed the isle of man he said go to london or paris paris for choice that'd do you good have you seen paris i should think i have i've knocked about there a little and is it really so beautiful as they say asked little chandler he sipped a little of his drink while ignatius gallaher finished his boldly beautiful said ignatius gallaher pausing on the word and on the flavour of his drink it's not so beautiful you know of course it is beautiful but it's the life of paris that's the thing ah there's no city like paris for gaiety movement excitement little chandler finished his whisky and after some trouble succeeded in catching the barman's eye he ordered the same again i've been to the moulin rouge ignatius gallaher continued when the barman had removed their glasses and i've been to all the bohemian cafÃ©s hot stuff not for a pious chap like you tommy little chandler said nothing until the barman returned with two glasses then he touched his friend's glass lightly and reciprocated the former toast he was beginning to feel somewhat disillusioned gallaher's accent and way of expressing himself did not please him there was something vulgar in his friend which he had not observed before but perhaps it was only the result of living in london amid the bustle and competition of the press the old personal charm was still there under this new gaudy manner and after all gallaher had lived he had seen the world little chandler looked at his friend enviously everything in paris is gay said ignatius gallaher they believe in enjoying life and don't you think they're right if you want to enjoy yourself properly you must go to paris and mind you they've a great feeling for the irish there when they heard i was from ireland they were ready to eat me man little chandler took four or five sips from his glass tell me he said is it true that paris is so immoral as they say ignatius gallaher made a catholic gesture with his right arm every place is immoral he said of course you do find spicy bits in paris go to one of the students balls for instance that's lively if you like when the cocottes begin to let themselves loose you know what they are i suppose cocottes i've heard of them said little chandler ignatius gallaher drank off his whisky and shook his head ah he said you may say what you like there's no woman like the parisienne for style for go then it is an immoral city said little chandler with timid insistence i mean compared with london or dublin london said ignatius gallaher it's six of one and half-a-dozen of the other you ask hogan my boy i showed him a bit about london when he was over there he'd open your eye i say tommy don't make punch of that whisky liquor up no really o come on another one won't do you any harm what is it the same again i suppose well all right franÃ§ois the same again will you smoke tommy franÃ§ois ignatius gallaher produced his cigar-case the two friends lit their cigars and puffed at them in silence until their drinks were served i'll tell you my opinion said ignatius gallaher emerging after some time from the clouds of smoke in which he had taken refuge it's a rum world talk of immorality i've heard of cases what am i saying i've known them cases of immorality ignatius gallaher puffed thoughtfully at his cigar and then in a calm historian's tone he proceeded to sketch for his friend some pictures of the corruption which was rife abroad he summarised the vices of many capitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to berlin some things he could not vouch for his friends had told him but of others he had had personal experience he spared neither rank nor caste he revealed many of the secrets of religious houses on the continent and described some of the practices which were fashionable in high society and ended by telling with details a story about an english duchess a story which he knew to be true little chandler was astonished ah well said ignatius gallaher here we are in old jog-along dublin where nothing is known of such things how dull you must find it said little chandler after all the other places you've seen well said ignatius gallaher it's a relaxation to come over here you know and after all it's the old country as they say isn't it you can't help having a certain feeling for it that's human nature but tell me something about yourself hogan told me you had tasted the joys of connubial bliss two years ago wasn't it little chandler blushed and smiled yes he said i was married last may twelve months i hope it's not too late in the day to offer my best wishes said ignatius gallaher i didn't know your address or i'd have done so at the time he extended his hand which little chandler took well tommy he said i wish you and yours every joy in life old chap and tons of money and may you never die till i shoot you and that's the wish of a sincere friend an old friend you know that i know that said little chandler any youngsters said ignatius gallaher little chandler blushed again we have one child he said son or daughter a little boy ignatius gallaher slapped his friend sonorously on the back bravo he said i wouldn't doubt you tommy little chandler smiled looked confusedly at his glass and bit his lower lip with three childishly white front teeth i hope you'll spend an evening with us he said before you go back my wife will be delighted to meet you we can have a little music and thanks awfully old chap said ignatius gallaher i'm sorry we didn't meet earlier but i must leave tomorrow night tonight perhaps i'm awfully sorry old man you see i'm over here with another fellow clever young chap he is too and we arranged to go to a little card-party only for that o in that case but who knows said ignatius gallaher considerately next year i may take a little skip over here now that i've broken the ice it's only a pleasure deferred very well said little chandler the next time you come we must have an evening together that's agreed now isn't it yes that's agreed said ignatius gallaher next year if i come parole d'honneur parole d'honneur and to clinch the bargain said little chandler we'll just have one more now ignatius gallaher took out a large gold watch and looked at it is it to be the last he said because you know i have an a p o yes positively said little chandler very well then said ignatius gallaher let us have another one as a deoc an doruis that's good vernacular for a small whisky i believe deoc an doruis little chandler ordered the drinks the blush which had risen to his face a few moments before was establishing itself a trifle made him blush at any time and now he felt warm and excited three small whiskies had gone to his head and gallaher's strong cigar had confused his mind for he was a delicate and abstinent person the adventure of meeting gallaher after eight years of finding himself with gallaher in corless's surrounded by lights and noise of listening to gallaher's stories and of sharing for a brief space gallaher's vagrant and triumphant life upset the equipoise of his sensitive nature he felt acutely the contrast between his own life and his friend's and it seemed to him unjust gallaher was his inferior in birth and education he was sure that he could do something better than his friend had ever done or could ever do something higher than mere tawdry journalism if he only got the chance what was it that stood in his way his unfortunate timidity he wished to vindicate himself in some way to assert his manhood he saw behind gallaher's refusal of his invitation gallaher was only patronising him by his friendliness just as he was patronising ireland by his visit the barman brought their drinks little chandler pushed one glass towards his friend and took up the other boldly who knows he said as they lifted their glasses when you come next year i may have the pleasure of wishing long life and happiness to mister and missus ignatius gallaher ignatius gallaher in the act of drinking closed one eye expressively over the rim of his glass when he had drunk he smacked his lips decisively set down his glass and said no blooming fear of that my boy i'm going to have my fling first and see a bit of life and the world before i put my head in the sack if i ever do some day you will said little chandler calmly ignatius gallaher turned his orange tie and slate-blue eyes full upon his friend you think so he said you'll put your head in the sack repeated little chandler stoutly like everyone else if you can find the girl he had slightly emphasised his tone and he was aware that he had betrayed himself but though the colour had heightened in his cheek he did not flinch from his friend's gaze ignatius gallaher watched him for a few moments and then said if ever it occurs you may bet your bottom dollar there'll be no mooning and spooning about it i mean to marry money she'll have a good fat account at the bank or she won't do for me little chandler shook his head why man alive said ignatius gallaher vehemently do you know what it is i've only to say the word and tomorrow i can have the woman and the cash you don't believe it well i know it there are hundreds what am i saying thousands of rich germans and jews rotten with money that'd only be too glad you wait a while my boy see if i don't play my cards properly when i go about a thing i mean business i tell you you just wait he tossed his glass to his mouth finished his drink and laughed loudly then he looked thoughtfully before him and said in a calmer tone but i'm in no hurry they can wait i don't fancy tying myself up to one woman you know he imitated with his mouth the act of tasting and made a wry face must get a bit stale i should think he said little chandler sat in the room off the hall holding a child in his arms to save money they kept no servant but annie's young sister monica came for an hour or so in the morning and an hour or so in the evening to help but monica had gone home long ago it was a quarter to nine little chandler had come home late for tea and moreover he had forgotten to bring annie home the parcel of coffee from bewley's of course she was in a bad humour and gave him short answers she said she would do without any tea but when it came near the time at which the shop at the corner closed she decided to go out herself for a quarter of a pound of tea and two pounds of sugar she put the sleeping child deftly in his arms and said here don't waken him a little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and its light fell over a photograph which was enclosed in a frame of crumpled horn it was annie's photograph little chandler looked at it pausing at the thin tight lips she wore the pale blue summer blouse which he had brought her home as a present one saturday it had cost him ten and elevenpence but what an agony of nervousness it had cost him how he had suffered that day waiting at the shop door until the shop was empty standing at the counter and trying to appear at his ease while the girl piled ladies blouses before him paying at the desk and forgetting to take up the odd penny of his change being called back by the cashier and finally striving to hide his blushes as he left the shop by examining the parcel to see if it was securely tied when he brought the blouse home annie kissed him and said it was very pretty and stylish but when she heard the price she threw the blouse on the table and said it was a regular swindle to charge ten and elevenpence for it at first she wanted to take it back but when she tried it on she was delighted with it especially with the make of the sleeves and kissed him and said he was very good to think of her hm he looked coldly into the eyes of the photograph and they answered coldly certainly they were pretty and the face itself was pretty but he found something mean in it why was it so unconscious and ladylike the composure of the eyes irritated him they repelled him and defied him there was no passion in them no rapture he thought of what gallaher had said about rich jewesses those dark oriental eyes he thought how full they are of passion of voluptuous longing why had he married the eyes in the photograph he caught himself up at the question and glanced nervously round the room he found something mean in the pretty furniture which he had bought for his house on the hire system annie had chosen it herself and it reminded him of her it too was prim and pretty a dull resentment against his life awoke within him could he not escape from his little house was it too late for him to try to live bravely like gallaher could he go to london there was the furniture still to be paid for if he could only write a book and get it published that might open the way for him a volume of byron's poems lay before him on the table he opened it cautiously with his left hand lest he should waken the child and began to read the first poem in the book hushed are the winds and still the evening gloom not e'en a zephyr wanders through the grove whilst i return to view my margaret's tomb and scatter flowers on the dust i love hushed are the winds and still the evening gloom not e'en a zephyr wanders through the grove whilst i return to view my margaret's tomb and scatter flowers on the dust i love he paused he felt the rhythm of the verse about him in the room how melancholy it was could he too write like that express the melancholy of his soul in verse there were so many things he wanted to describe his sensation of a few hours before on grattan bridge for example if he could get back again into that mood the child awoke and began to cry he turned from the page and tried to hush it but it would not be hushed he began to rock it to and fro in his arms but its wailing cry grew keener he rocked it faster while his eyes began to read the second stanza within this narrow cell reclines her clay that clay where once within this narrow cell reclines her clay that clay where once it was useless he couldn't read he couldn't do anything the wailing of the child pierced the drum of his ear it was useless useless he was a prisoner for life his arms trembled with anger and suddenly bending to the child's face he shouted stop the child stopped for an instant had a spasm of fright and began to scream he jumped up from his chair and walked hastily up and down the room with the child in his arms it began to sob piteously losing its breath for four or five seconds and then bursting out anew the thin walls of the room echoed the sound he tried to soothe it but it sobbed more convulsively he looked at the contracted and quivering face of the child and began to be alarmed he counted seven sobs without a break between them and caught the child to his breast in fright if it died the door was burst open and a young woman ran in panting what is it what is it she cried the child hearing its mother's voice broke out into a paroxysm of sobbing it's nothing annie it's nothing he began to cry she flung her parcels on the floor and snatched the child from him what have you done to him she cried glaring into his face little chandler sustained for one moment the gaze of her eyes and his heart closed together as he met the hatred in them he began to stammer it's nothing he he began to cry i couldn't i didn't do anything what giving no heed to him she began to walk up and down the room clasping the child tightly in her arms and murmuring my little man my little mannie was 'ou frightened love there now love there now lambabaun mamma's little lamb of the world there now little chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back out of the lamplight he listened while the paroxysm of the child's sobbing grew less and less and tears of remorse started to his eyes
