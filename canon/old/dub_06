the grey warm evening of august had descended upon the city and a mild warm air a memory of summer circulated in the streets the streets shuttered for the repose of sunday swarmed with a gaily coloured crowd like illumined pearls the lamps shone from the summits of their tall poles upon the living texture below which changing shape and hue unceasingly sent up into the warm grey evening air an unchanging unceasing murmur two young men came down the hill of rutland square one of them was just bringing a long monologue to a close the other who walked on the verge of the path and was at times obliged to step on to the road owing to his companion's rudeness wore an amused listening face he was squat and ruddy a yachting cap was shoved far back from his forehead and the narrative to which he listened made constant waves of expression break forth over his face from the corners of his nose and eyes and mouth little jets of wheezing laughter followed one another out of his convulsed body his eyes twinkling with cunning enjoyment glanced at every moment towards his companion's face once or twice he rearranged the light waterproof which he had slung over one shoulder in toreador fashion his breeches his white rubber shoes and his jauntily slung waterproof expressed youth but his figure fell into rotundity at the waist his hair was scant and grey and his face when the waves of expression had passed over it had a ravaged look when he was quite sure that the narrative had ended he laughed noiselessly for fully half a minute then he said well that takes the biscuit his voice seemed winnowed of vigour and to enforce his words he added with humour that takes the solitary unique and if i may so call it recherchÃ© biscuit recherchÃ© he became serious and silent when he had said this his tongue was tired for he had been talking all the afternoon in a public-house in dorset street most people considered lenehan a leech but in spite of this reputation his adroitness and eloquence had always prevented his friends from forming any general policy against him he had a brave manner of coming up to a party of them in a bar and of holding himself nimbly at the borders of the company until he was included in a round he was a sporting vagrant armed with a vast stock of stories limericks and riddles he was insensitive to all kinds of discourtesy no one knew how he achieved the stern task of living but his name was vaguely associated with racing tissues and where did you pick her up corley he asked corley ran his tongue swiftly along his upper lip one night man he said i was going along dame street and i spotted a fine tart under waterhouse's clock and said good-night you know so we went for a walk round by the canal and she told me she was a slavey in a house in baggot street i put my arm round her and squeezed her a bit that night then next sunday man i met her by appointment we went out to donnybrook and i brought her into a field there she told me she used to go with a dairyman it was fine man cigarettes every night she'd bring me and paying the tram out and back and one night she brought me two bloody fine cigars o the real cheese you know that the old fellow used to smoke i was afraid man she'd get in the family way but she's up to the dodge maybe she thinks you'll marry her said lenehan i told her i was out of a job said corley i told her i was in pim's she doesn't know my name i was too hairy to tell her that but she thinks i'm a bit of class you know lenehan laughed again noiselessly of all the good ones ever i heard he said that emphatically takes the biscuit corley's stride acknowledged the compliment the swing of his burly body made his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the roadway and back again corley was the son of an inspector of police and he had inherited his father's frame and gait he walked with his hands by his sides holding himself erect and swaying his head from side to side his head was large globular and oily it sweated in all weathers and his large round hat set upon it sideways looked like a bulb which had grown out of another he always stared straight before him as if he were on parade and when he wished to gaze after someone in the street it was necessary for him to move his body from the hips at present he was about town whenever any job was vacant a friend was always ready to give him the hard word he was often to be seen walking with policemen in plain clothes talking earnestly he knew the inner side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments he spoke without listening to the speech of his companions his conversation was mainly about himself what he had said to such a person and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to settle the matter when he reported these dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after the manner of florentines lenehan offered his friend a cigarette as the two young men walked on through the crowd corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the passing girls but lenehan's gaze was fixed on the large faint moon circled with a double halo he watched earnestly the passing of the grey web of twilight across its face at length he said well tell me corley i suppose you'll be able to pull it off all right eh corley closed one eye expressively as an answer is she game for that asked lenehan dubiously you can never know women she's all right said corley i know the way to get around her man she's a bit gone on me you're what i call a gay lothario said lenehan and the proper kind of a lothario too a shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner to save himself he had the habit of leaving his flattery open to the interpretation of raillery but corley had not a subtle mind there's nothing to touch a good slavey he affirmed take my tip for it by one who has tried them all said lenehan first i used to go with girls you know said corley unbosoming girls off the south circular i used to take them out man on the tram somewhere and pay the tram or take them to a band or a play at the theatre or buy them chocolate and sweets or something that way i used to spend money on them right enough he added in a convincing tone as if he was conscious of being disbelieved but lenehan could well believe it he nodded gravely i know that game he said and it's a mug's game and damn the thing i ever got out of it said corley ditto here said lenehan only off of one of them said corley he moistened his upper lip by running his tongue along it the recollection brightened his eyes he too gazed at the pale disc of the moon now nearly veiled and seemed to meditate she was a bit of all right he said regretfully he was silent again then he added she's on the turf now i saw her driving down earl street one night with two fellows with her on a car i suppose that's your doing said lenehan there was others at her before me said corley philosophically this time lenehan was inclined to disbelieve he shook his head to and fro and smiled you know you can't kid me corley he said honest to god said corley didn't she tell me herself lenehan made a tragic gesture base betrayer he said as they passed along the railings of trinity college lenehan skipped out into the road and peered up at the clock twenty after he said time enough said corley she'll be there all right i always let her wait a bit lenehan laughed quietly ecod corley you know how to take them he said i'm up to all their little tricks corley confessed but tell me said lenehan again are you sure you can bring it off all right you know it's a ticklish job they're damn close on that point eh what his bright small eyes searched his companion's face for reassurance corley swung his head to and fro as if to toss aside an insistent insect and his brows gathered i'll pull it off he said leave it to me can't you lenehan said no more he did not wish to ruffle his friend's temper to be sent to the devil and told that his advice was not wanted a little tact was necessary but corley's brow was soon smooth again his thoughts were running another way she's a fine decent tart he said with appreciation that's what she is they walked along nassau street and then turned into kildare street not far from the porch of the club a harpist stood in the roadway playing to a little ring of listeners he plucked at the wires heedlessly glancing quickly from time to time at the face of each new-comer and from time to time wearily also at the sky his harp too heedless that her coverings had fallen about her knees seemed weary alike of the eyes of strangers and of her master's hands one hand played in the bass the melody of silent o moyle while the other hand careered in the treble after each group of notes the notes of the air sounded deep and full silent o moyle the two young men walked up the street without speaking the mournful music following them when they reached stephen's green they crossed the road here the noise of trams the lights and the crowd released them from their silence there she is said corley at the corner of hume street a young woman was standing she wore a blue dress and a white sailor hat she stood on the curbstone swinging a sunshade in one hand lenehan grew lively let's have a look at her corley he said corley glanced sideways at his friend and an unpleasant grin appeared on his face are you trying to get inside me he asked damn it said lenehan boldly i don't want an introduction all i want is to have a look at her i'm not going to eat her o a look at her said corley more amiably well i'll tell you what i'll go over and talk to her and you can pass by right said lenehan corley had already thrown one leg over the chains when lenehan called out and after where will we meet half ten answered corley bringing over his other leg where corner of merrion street we'll be coming back work it all right now said lenehan in farewell corley did not answer he sauntered across the road swaying his head from side to side his bulk his easy pace and the solid sound of his boots had something of the conqueror in them he approached the young woman and without saluting began at once to converse with her she swung her umbrella more quickly and executed half turns on her heels once or twice when he spoke to her at close quarters she laughed and bent her head lenehan observed them for a few minutes then he walked rapidly along beside the chains at some distance and crossed the road obliquely as he approached hume street corner he found the air heavily scented and his eyes made a swift anxious scrutiny of the young woman's appearance she had her sunday finery on her blue serge skirt was held at the waist by a belt of black leather the great silver buckle of her belt seemed to depress the centre of her body catching the light stuff of her white blouse like a clip she wore a short black jacket with mother-of-pearl buttons and a ragged black boa the ends of her tulle collarette had been carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers was pinned in her bosom stems upwards lenehan's eyes noted approvingly her stout short muscular body frank rude health glowed in her face on her fat red cheeks and in her unabashed blue eyes her features were blunt she had broad nostrils a straggling mouth which lay open in a contented leer and two projecting front teeth as he passed lenehan took off his cap and after about ten seconds corley returned a salute to the air this he did by raising his hand vaguely and pensively changing the angle of position of his hat lenehan walked as far as the shelbourne hotel where he halted and waited after waiting for a little time he saw them coming towards him and when they turned to the right he followed them stepping lightly in his white shoes down one side of merrion square as he walked on slowly timing his pace to theirs he watched corley's head which turned at every moment towards the young woman's face like a big ball revolving on a pivot he kept the pair in view until he had seen them climbing the stairs of the donnybrook tram then he turned about and went back the way he had come now that he was alone his face looked older his gaiety seemed to forsake him and as he came by the railings of the duke's lawn he allowed his hand to run along them the air which the harpist had played began to control his movements his softly padded feet played the melody while his fingers swept a scale of variations idly along the railings after each group of notes he walked listlessly round stephen's green and then down grafton street though his eyes took note of many elements of the crowd through which he passed they did so morosely he found trivial all that was meant to charm him and did not answer the glances which invited him to be bold he knew that he would have to speak a great deal to invent and to amuse and his brain and throat were too dry for such a task the problem of how he could pass the hours till he met corley again troubled him a little he could think of no way of passing them but to keep on walking he turned to the left when he came to the corner of rutland square and felt more at ease in the dark quiet street the sombre look of which suited his mood he paused at last before the window of a poor-looking shop over which the words refreshment bar were printed in white letters on the glass of the window were two flying inscriptions ginger beer and ginger ale a cut ham was exposed on a great blue dish while near it on a plate lay a segment of very light plum-pudding he eyed this food earnestly for some time and then after glancing warily up and down the street went into the shop quickly refreshment bar ginger beer ginger ale he was hungry for except some biscuits which he had asked two grudging curates to bring him he had eaten nothing since breakfast-time he sat down at an uncovered wooden table opposite two work-girls and a mechanic a slatternly girl waited on him how much is a plate of peas he asked three halfpence sir said the girl bring me a plate of peas he said and a bottle of ginger beer he spoke roughly in order to belie his air of gentility for his entry had been followed by a pause of talk his face was heated to appear natural he pushed his cap back on his head and planted his elbows on the table the mechanic and the two work-girls examined him point by point before resuming their conversation in a subdued voice the girl brought him a plate of grocer's hot peas seasoned with pepper and vinegar a fork and his ginger beer he ate his food greedily and found it so good that he made a note of the shop mentally when he had eaten all the peas he sipped his ginger beer and sat for some time thinking of corley's adventure in his imagination he beheld the pair of lovers walking along some dark road he heard corley's voice in deep energetic gallantries and saw again the leer of the young woman's mouth this vision made him feel keenly his own poverty of purse and spirit he was tired of knocking about of pulling the devil by the tail of shifts and intrigues he would be thirty-one in november would he never get a good job would he never have a home of his own he thought how pleasant it would be to have a warm fire to sit by and a good dinner to sit down to he had walked the streets long enough with friends and with girls he knew what those friends were worth he knew the girls too experience had embittered his heart against the world but all hope had not left him he felt better after having eaten than he had felt before less weary of his life less vanquished in spirit he might yet be able to settle down in some snug corner and live happily if he could only come across some good simple-minded girl with a little of the ready he paid twopence halfpenny to the slatternly girl and went out of the shop to begin his wandering again he went into capel street and walked along towards the city hall then he turned into dame street at the corner of george's street he met two friends of his and stopped to converse with them he was glad that he could rest from all his walking his friends asked him had he seen corley and what was the latest he replied that he had spent the day with corley his friends talked very little they looked vacantly after some figures in the crowd and sometimes made a critical remark one said that he had seen mac an hour before in westmoreland street at this lenehan said that he had been with mac the night before in egan's the young man who had seen mac in westmoreland street asked was it true that mac had won a bit over a billiard match lenehan did not know he said that holohan had stood them drinks in egan's he left his friends at a quarter to ten and went up george's street he turned to the left at the city markets and walked on into grafton street the crowd of girls and young men had thinned and on his way up the street he heard many groups and couples bidding one another good-night he went as far as the clock of the college of surgeons it was on the stroke of ten he set off briskly along the northern side of the green hurrying for fear corley should return too soon when he reached the corner of merrion street he took his stand in the shadow of a lamp and brought out one of the cigarettes which he had reserved and lit it he leaned against the lamp-post and kept his gaze fixed on the part from which he expected to see corley and the young woman return his mind became active again he wondered had corley managed it successfully he wondered if he had asked her yet or if he would leave it to the last he suffered all the pangs and thrills of his friend's situation as well as those of his own but the memory of corley's slowly revolving head calmed him somewhat he was sure corley would pull it off all right all at once the idea struck him that perhaps corley had seen her home by another way and given him the slip his eyes searched the street there was no sign of them yet it was surely half-an-hour since he had seen the clock of the college of surgeons would corley do a thing like that he lit his last cigarette and began to smoke it nervously he strained his eyes as each tram stopped at the far corner of the square they must have gone home by another way the paper of his cigarette broke and he flung it into the road with a curse suddenly he saw them coming towards him he started with delight and keeping close to his lamp-post tried to read the result in their walk they were walking quickly the young woman taking quick short steps while corley kept beside her with his long stride they did not seem to be speaking an intimation of the result pricked him like the point of a sharp instrument he knew corley would fail he knew it was no go they turned down baggot street and he followed them at once taking the other footpath when they stopped he stopped too they talked for a few moments and then the young woman went down the steps into the area of a house corley remained standing at the edge of the path a little distance from the front steps some minutes passed then the hall-door was opened slowly and cautiously a woman came running down the front steps and coughed corley turned and went towards her his broad figure hid hers from view for a few seconds and then she reappeared running up the steps the door closed on her and corley began to walk swiftly towards stephen's green lenehan hurried on in the same direction some drops of light rain fell he took them as a warning and glancing back towards the house which the young woman had entered to see that he was not observed he ran eagerly across the road anxiety and his swift run made him pant he called out hallo corley corley turned his head to see who had called him and then continued walking as before lenehan ran after him settling the waterproof on his shoulders with one hand hallo corley he cried again he came level with his friend and looked keenly in his face he could see nothing there well he said did it come off they had reached the corner of ely place still without answering corley swerved to the left and went up the side street his features were composed in stern calm lenehan kept up with his friend breathing uneasily he was baffled and a note of menace pierced through his voice can't you tell us he said did you try her corley halted at the first lamp and stared grimly before him then with a grave gesture he extended a hand towards the light and smiling opened it slowly to the gaze of his disciple a small gold coin shone in the palm
