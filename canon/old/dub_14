two gentlemen who were in the lavatory at the time tried to lift him up but he was quite helpless he lay curled up at the foot of the stairs down which he had fallen they succeeded in turning him over his hat had rolled a few yards away and his clothes were smeared with the filth and ooze of the floor on which he had lain face downwards his eyes were closed and he breathed with a grunting noise a thin stream of blood trickled from the corner of his mouth these two gentlemen and one of the curates carried him up the stairs and laid him down again on the floor of the bar in two minutes he was surrounded by a ring of men the manager of the bar asked everyone who he was and who was with him no one knew who he was but one of the curates said he had served the gentleman with a small rum was he by himself asked the manager no sir there was two gentlemen with him and where are they no one knew a voice said give him air he's fainted the ring of onlookers distended and closed again elastically a dark medal of blood had formed itself near the man's head on the tessellated floor the manager alarmed by the grey pallor of the man's face sent for a policeman his collar was unfastened and his necktie undone he opened his eyes for an instant sighed and closed them again one of gentlemen who had carried him upstairs held a dinged silk hat in his hand the manager asked repeatedly did no one know who the injured man was or where had his friends gone the door of the bar opened and an immense constable entered a crowd which had followed him down the laneway collected outside the door struggling to look in through the glass panels the manager at once began to narrate what he knew the constable a young man with thick immobile features listened he moved his head slowly to right and left and from the manager to the person on the floor as if he feared to be the victim of some delusion then he drew off his glove produced a small book from his waist licked the lead of his pencil and made ready to indite he asked in a suspicious provincial accent who is the man what's his name and address a young man in a cycling-suit cleared his way through the ring of bystanders he knelt down promptly beside the injured man and called for water the constable knelt down also to help the young man washed the blood from the injured man's mouth and then called for some brandy the constable repeated the order in an authoritative voice until a curate came running with the glass the brandy was forced down the man's throat in a few seconds he opened his eyes and looked about him he looked at the circle of faces and then understanding strove to rise to his feet you're all right now asked the young man in the cycling-suit sha 's nothing said the injured man trying to stand up he was helped to his feet the manager said something about a hospital and some of the bystanders gave advice the battered silk hat was placed on the man's head the constable asked where do you live the man without answering began to twirl the ends of his moustache he made light of his accident it was nothing he said only a little accident he spoke very thickly where do you live repeated the constable the man said they were to get a cab for him while the point was being debated a tall agile gentleman of fair complexion wearing a long yellow ulster came from the far end of the bar seeing the spectacle he called out hallo tom old man what's the trouble sha 's nothing said the man the new-comer surveyed the deplorable figure before him and then turned to the constable saying it's all right constable i'll see him home the constable touched his helmet and answered all right mister power come now tom said mister power taking his friend by the arm no bones broken what can you walk the young man in the cycling-suit took the man by the other arm and the crowd divided how did you get yourself into this mess asked mister power the gentleman fell down the stairs said the young man i 'ery 'uch o'liged to you sir said the injured man not at all 'ant we have a little not now not now the three men left the bar and the crowd sifted through the doors into the laneway the manager brought the constable to the stairs to inspect the scene of the accident they agreed that the gentleman must have missed his footing the customers returned to the counter and a curate set about removing the traces of blood from the floor when they came out into grafton street mister power whistled for an outsider the injured man said again as well as he could i 'ery 'uch o'liged to you sir i hope we'll 'eet again 'y na'e is kernan the shock and the incipient pain had partly sobered him don't mention it said the young man they shook hands mister kernan was hoisted on to the car and while mister power was giving directions to the carman he expressed his gratitude to the young man and regretted that they could not have a little drink together another time said the young man the car drove off towards westmoreland street as it passed ballast office the clock showed half-past nine a keen east wind hit them blowing from the mouth of the river mister kernan was huddled together with cold his friend asked him to tell how the accident had happened i 'an't 'an he answered 'y 'ongue is hurt show the other leaned over the well of the car and peered into mister kernan's mouth but he could not see he struck a match and sheltering it in the shell of his hands peered again into the mouth which mister kernan opened obediently the swaying movement of the car brought the match to and from the opened mouth the lower teeth and gums were covered with clotted blood and a minute piece of the tongue seemed to have been bitten off the match was blown out that's ugly said mister power sha 's nothing said mister kernan closing his mouth and pulling the collar of his filthy coat across his neck mister kernan was a commercial traveller of the old school which believed in the dignity of its calling he had never been seen in the city without a silk hat of some decency and a pair of gaiters by grace of these two articles of clothing he said a man could always pass muster he carried on the tradition of his napoleon the great blackwhite whose memory he evoked at times by legend and mimicry modern business methods had spared him only so far as to allow him a little office in crowe street on the window blind of which was written the name of his firm with the address london e c on the mantelpiece of this little office a little leaden battalion of canisters was drawn up and on the table before the window stood four or five china bowls which were usually half full of a black liquid from these bowls mister kernan tasted tea he took a mouthful drew it up saturated his palate with it and then spat it forth into the grate then he paused to judge mister power a much younger man was employed in the royal irish constabulary office in dublin castle the arc of his social rise intersected the arc of his friend's decline but mister kernan's decline was mitigated by the fact that certain of those friends who had known him at his highest point of success still esteemed him as a character mister power was one of these friends his inexplicable debts were a byword in his circle he was a debonair young man the car halted before a small house on the glasnevin road and mister kernan was helped into the house his wife put him to bed while mister power sat downstairs in the kitchen asking the children where they went to school and what book they were in the children two girls and a boy conscious of their father's helplessness and of their mother's absence began some horseplay with him he was surprised at their manners and at their accents and his brow grew thoughtful after a while missus kernan entered the kitchen exclaiming such a sight o he'll do for himself one day and that's the holy alls of it he's been drinking since friday mister power was careful to explain to her that he was not responsible that he had come on the scene by the merest accident missus kernan remembering mister power's good offices during domestic quarrels as well as many small but opportune loans said o you needn't tell me that mister power i know you're a friend of his not like some of the others he does be with they're all right so long as he has money in his pocket to keep him out from his wife and family nice friends who was he with tonight i'd like to know mister power shook his head but said nothing i'm so sorry she continued that i've nothing in the house to offer you but if you wait a minute i'll send round to fogarty's at the corner mister power stood up we were waiting for him to come home with the money he never seems to think he has a home at all o now missus kernan said mister power we'll make him turn over a new leaf i'll talk to martin he's the man we'll come here one of these nights and talk it over she saw him to the door the carman was stamping up and down the footpath and swinging his arms to warm himself it's very kind of you to bring him home she said not at all said mister power he got up on the car as it drove off he raised his hat to her gaily we'll make a new man of him he said good-night missus kernan missus kernan's puzzled eyes watched the car till it was out of sight then she withdrew them went into the house and emptied her husband's pockets she was an active practical woman of middle age not long before she had celebrated her silver wedding and renewed her intimacy with her husband by waltzing with him to mister power's accompaniment in her days of courtship mister kernan had seemed to her a not ungallant figure and she still hurried to the chapel door whenever a wedding was reported and seeing the bridal pair recalled with vivid pleasure how she had passed out of the star of the sea church in sandymount leaning on the arm of a jovial well-fed man who was dressed smartly in a frock-coat and lavender trousers and carried a silk hat gracefully balanced upon his other arm after three weeks she had found a wife's life irksome and later on when she was beginning to find it unbearable she had become a mother the part of mother presented to her no insuperable difficulties and for twenty-five years she had kept house shrewdly for her husband her two eldest sons were launched one was in a draper's shop in glasgow and the other was clerk to a tea-merchant in belfast they were good sons wrote regularly and sometimes sent home money the other children were still at school mister kernan sent a letter to his office next day and remained in bed she made beef-tea for him and scolded him roundly she accepted his frequent intemperance as part of the climate healed him dutifully whenever he was sick and always tried to make him eat a breakfast there were worse husbands he had never been violent since the boys had grown up and she knew that he would walk to the end of thomas street and back again to book even a small order two nights after his friends came to see him she brought them up to his bedroom the air of which was impregnated with a personal odour and gave them chairs at the fire mister kernan's tongue the occasional stinging pain of which had made him somewhat irritable during the day became more polite he sat propped up in the bed by pillows and the little colour in his puffy cheeks made them resemble warm cinders he apologised to his guests for the disorder of the room but at the same time looked at them a little proudly with a veteran's pride he was quite unconscious that he was the victim of a plot which his friends mister cunningham mister m'coy and mister power had disclosed to missus kernan in the parlour the idea had been mister power's but its development was entrusted to mister cunningham mister kernan came of protestant stock and though he had been converted to the catholic faith at the time of his marriage he had not been in the pale of the church for twenty years he was fond moreover of giving side-thrusts at catholicism mister cunningham was the very man for such a case he was an elder colleague of mister power his own domestic life was not very happy people had great sympathy with him for it was known that he had married an unpresentable woman who was an incurable drunkard he had set up house for her six times and each time she had pawned the furniture on him everyone had respect for poor martin cunningham he was a thoroughly sensible man influential and intelligent his blade of human knowledge natural astuteness particularised by long association with cases in the police courts had been tempered by brief immersions in the waters of general philosophy he was well informed his friends bowed to his opinions and considered that his face was like shakespeare's when the plot had been disclosed to her missus kernan had said i leave it all in your hands mister cunningham after a quarter of a century of married life she had very few illusions left religion for her was a habit and she suspected that a man of her husband's age would not change greatly before death she was tempted to see a curious appropriateness in his accident and but that she did not wish to seem bloody-minded she would have told the gentlemen that mister kernan's tongue would not suffer by being shortened however mister cunningham was a capable man and religion was religion the scheme might do good and at least it could do no harm her beliefs were not extravagant she believed steadily in the sacred heart as the most generally useful of all catholic devotions and approved of the sacraments her faith was bounded by her kitchen but if she was put to it she could believe also in the banshee and in the holy ghost the gentlemen began to talk of the accident mister cunningham said that he had once known a similar case a man of seventy had bitten off a piece of his tongue during an epileptic fit and the tongue had filled in again so that no one could see a trace of the bite well i'm not seventy said the invalid god forbid said mister cunningham it doesn't pain you now asked mister m'coy mister m'coy had been at one time a tenor of some reputation his wife who had been a soprano still taught young children to play the piano at low terms his line of life had not been the shortest distance between two points and for short periods he had been driven to live by his wits he had been a clerk in the midland railway a canvasser for advertisements for the irish times and for the freeman's journal a town traveller for a coal firm on commission a private inquiry agent a clerk in the office of the sub-sheriff and he had recently become secretary to the city coroner his new office made him professionally interested in mister kernan's case the irish times the freeman's journal pain not much answered mister kernan but it's so sickening i feel as if i wanted to retch off that's the boose said mister cunningham firmly no said mister kernan i think i caught a cold on the car there's something keeps coming into my throat phlegm or mucus said mister m'coy it keeps coming like from down in my throat sickening thing yes yes said mister m'coy that's the thorax he looked at mister cunningham and mister power at the same time with an air of challenge mister cunningham nodded his head rapidly and mister power said ah well all's well that ends well i'm very much obliged to you old man said the invalid mister power waved his hand those other two fellows i was with who were you with asked mister cunningham a chap i don't know his name damn it now what's his name little chap with sandy hair and who else harford hm said mister cunningham when mister cunningham made that remark people were silent it was known that the speaker had secret sources of information in this case the monosyllable had a moral intention mister harford sometimes formed one of a little detachment which left the city shortly after noon on sunday with the purpose of arriving as soon as possible at some public-house on the outskirts of the city where its members duly qualified themselves as bona fide travellers but his fellow-travellers had never consented to overlook his origin he had begun life as an obscure financier by lending small sums of money to workmen at usurious interest later on he had become the partner of a very fat short gentleman mister goldberg in the liffey loan bank though he had never embraced more than the jewish ethical code his fellow-catholics whenever they had smarted in person or by proxy under his exactions spoke of him bitterly as an irish jew and an illiterate and saw divine disapproval of usury made manifest through the person of his idiot son at other times they remembered his good points bona fide i wonder where did he go to said mister kernan he wished the details of the incident to remain vague he wished his friends to think there had been some mistake that mister harford and he had missed each other his friends who knew quite well mister harford's manners in drinking were silent mister power said again all's well that ends well mister kernan changed the subject at once that was a decent young chap that medical fellow he said only for him o only for him said mister power it might have been a case of seven days without the option of a fine yes yes said mister kernan trying to remember i remember now there was a policeman decent young fellow he seemed how did it happen at all it happened that you were peloothered tom said mister cunningham gravely true bill said mister kernan equally gravely i suppose you squared the constable jack said mister m'coy mister power did not relish the use of his christian name he was not straight-laced but he could not forget that mister m'coy had recently made a crusade in search of valises and portmanteaus to enable missus m'coy to fulfil imaginary engagements in the country more than he resented the fact that he had been victimised he resented such low playing of the game he answered the question therefore as if mister kernan had asked it the narrative made mister kernan indignant he was keenly conscious of his citizenship wished to live with his city on terms mutually honourable and resented any affront put upon him by those whom he called country bumpkins is this what we pay rates for he asked to feed and clothe these ignorant bostooms and they're nothing else mister cunningham laughed he was a castle official only during office hours how could they be anything else tom he said he assumed a thick provincial accent and said in a tone of command sixty five catch your cabbage everyone laughed mister m'coy who wanted to enter the conversation by any door pretended that he had never heard the story mister cunningham said it is supposed they say you know to take place in the depot where they get these thundering big country fellows omadhauns you know to drill the sergeant makes them stand in a row against the wall and hold up their plates he illustrated the story by grotesque gestures at dinner you know then he has a bloody big bowl of cabbage before him on the table and a bloody big spoon like a shovel he takes up a wad of cabbage on the spoon and pegs it across the room and the poor devils have to try and catch it on their plates sixty five catch your cabbage catch your cabbage everyone laughed again but mister kernan was somewhat indignant still he talked of writing a letter to the papers these yahoos coming up here he said think they can boss the people i needn't tell you martin what kind of men they are mister cunningham gave a qualified assent it's like everything else in this world he said you get some bad ones and you get some good ones o yes you get some good ones i admit said mister kernan satisfied it's better to have nothing to say to them said mister m'coy that's my opinion missus kernan entered the room and placing a tray on the table said help yourselves gentlemen mister power stood up to officiate offering her his chair she declined it saying she was ironing downstairs and after having exchanged a nod with mister cunningham behind mister power's back prepared to leave the room her husband called out to her and have you nothing for me duckie o you the back of my hand to you said missus kernan tartly her husband called after her nothing for poor little hubby he assumed such a comical face and voice that the distribution of the bottles of stout took place amid general merriment the gentlemen drank from their glasses set the glasses again on the table and paused then mister cunningham turned towards mister power and said casually on thursday night you said jack thursday yes said mister power righto said mister cunningham promptly we can meet in m'auley's said mister m'coy that'll be the most convenient place but we mustn't be late said mister power earnestly because it is sure to be crammed to the doors we can meet at half-seven said mister m'coy righto said mister cunningham half-seven at m'auley's be it there was a short silence mister kernan waited to see whether he would be taken into his friends confidence then he asked what's in the wind o it's nothing said mister cunningham it's only a little matter that we're arranging about for thursday the opera is it said mister kernan no no said mister cunningham in an evasive tone it's just a little spiritual matter o said mister kernan there was silence again then mister power said point blank to tell you the truth tom we're going to make a retreat yes that's it said mister cunningham jack and i and m'coy here we're all going to wash the pot he uttered the metaphor with a certain homely energy and encouraged by his own voice proceeded you see we may as well all admit we're a nice collection of scoundrels one and all i say one and all he added with gruff charity and turning to mister power own up now i own up said mister power and i own up said mister m'coy so we're going to wash the pot together said mister cunningham a thought seemed to strike him he turned suddenly to the invalid and said d'ye know what tom has just occurred to me you might join in and we'd have a four-handed reel good idea said mister power the four of us together mister kernan was silent the proposal conveyed very little meaning to his mind but understanding that some spiritual agencies were about to concern themselves on his behalf he thought he owed it to his dignity to show a stiff neck he took no part in the conversation for a long while but listened with an air of calm enmity while his friends discussed the jesuits i haven't such a bad opinion of the jesuits he said intervening at length they're an educated order i believe they mean well too they're the grandest order in the church tom said mister cunningham with enthusiasm the general of the jesuits stands next to the pope there's no mistake about it said mister m'coy if you want a thing well done and no flies about it you go to a jesuit they're the boyos have influence i'll tell you a case in point the jesuits are a fine body of men said mister power it's a curious thing said mister cunningham about the jesuit order every other order of the church had to be reformed at some time or other but the jesuit order was never once reformed it never fell away is that so asked mister m'coy that's a fact said mister cunningham that's history look at their church too said mister power look at the congregation they have the jesuits cater for the upper classes said mister m'coy of course said mister power yes said mister kernan that's why i have a feeling for them it's some of those secular priests ignorant bumptious they're all good men said mister cunningham each in his own way the irish priesthood is honoured all the world over o yes said mister power not like some of the other priesthoods on the continent said mister m'coy unworthy of the name perhaps you're right said mister kernan relenting of course i'm right said mister cunningham i haven't been in the world all this time and seen most sides of it without being a judge of character the gentlemen drank again one following another's example mister kernan seemed to be weighing something in his mind he was impressed he had a high opinion of mister cunningham as a judge of character and as a reader of faces he asked for particulars o it's just a retreat you know said mister cunningham father purdon is giving it it's for business men you know he won't be too hard on us tom said mister power persuasively father purdon father purdon said the invalid o you must know him tom said mister cunningham stoutly fine jolly fellow he's a man of the world like ourselves ah yes i think i know him rather red face tall that's the man and tell me martin is he a good preacher munno it's not exactly a sermon you know it's just kind of a friendly talk you know in a common-sense way mister kernan deliberated mister m'coy said father tom burke that was the boy o father tom burke said mister cunningham that was a born orator did you ever hear him tom did i ever hear him said the invalid nettled rather i heard him and yet they say he wasn't much of a theologian said mister cunningham is that so said mister m'coy o of course nothing wrong you know only sometimes they say he didn't preach what was quite orthodox ah he was a splendid man said mister m'coy i heard him once mister kernan continued i forget the subject of his discourse now crofton and i were in the back of the pit you know the the body said mister cunningham yes in the back near the door i forget now what o yes it was on the pope the late pope i remember it well upon my word it was magnificent the style of the oratory and his voice god hadn't he a voice the prisoner of the vatican he called him i remember crofton saying to me when we came out the prisoner of the vatican but he's an orangeman crofton isn't he said mister power course he is said mister kernan and a damned decent orangeman too we went into butler's in moore street faith i was genuinely moved tell you the god's truth and i remember well his very words kernan he said we worship at different altars he said but our belief is the same struck me as very well put kernan we worship at different altars but our belief is the same there's a good deal in that said mister power there used always to be crowds of protestants in the chapel where father tom was preaching there's not much difference between us said mister m'coy we both believe in he hesitated for a moment in the redeemer only they don't believe in the pope and in the mother of god but of course said mister cunningham quietly and effectively our religion is the religion the old original faith the not a doubt of it said mister kernan warmly missus kernan came to the door of the bedroom and announced here's a visitor for you who is it mister fogarty o come in come in a pale oval face came forward into the light the arch of its fair trailing moustache was repeated in the fair eyebrows looped above pleasantly astonished eyes mister fogarty was a modest grocer he had failed in business in a licensed house in the city because his financial condition had constrained him to tie himself to second-class distillers and brewers he had opened a small shop on glasnevin road where he flattered himself his manners would ingratiate him with the housewives of the district he bore himself with a certain grace complimented little children and spoke with a neat enunciation he was not without culture mister fogarty brought a gift with him a half-pint of special whisky he inquired politely for mister kernan placed his gift on the table and sat down with the company on equal terms mister kernan appreciated the gift all the more since he was aware that there was a small account for groceries unsettled between him and mister fogarty he said i wouldn't doubt you old man open that jack will you mister power again officiated glasses were rinsed and five small measures of whisky were poured out this new influence enlivened the conversation mister fogarty sitting on a small area of the chair was specially interested pope leo xiii said mister cunningham was one of the lights of the age his great idea you know was the union of the latin and greek churches that was the aim of his life i often heard he was one of the most intellectual men in europe said mister power i mean apart from his being pope so he was said mister cunningham if not the most so his motto you know as pope was lux upon lux light upon light the lux upon lux light upon light no no said mister fogarty eagerly i think you're wrong there it was lux in tenebris i think light in darkness lux in tenebris light in darkness o yes said mister m'coy tenebrae tenebrae allow me said mister cunningham positively it was lux upon lux and pius ix his predecessor's motto was crux upon crux that is cross upon cross to show the difference between their two pontificates lux upon lux crux upon crux cross upon cross the inference was allowed mister cunningham continued pope leo you know was a great scholar and a poet he had a strong face said mister kernan yes said mister cunningham he wrote latin poetry is that so said mister fogarty mister m'coy tasted his whisky contentedly and shook his head with a double intention saying that's no joke i can tell you we didn't learn that tom said mister power following mister m'coy's example when we went to the penny-a-week school there was many a good man went to the penny-a-week school with a sod of turf under his oxter said mister kernan sententiously the old system was the best plain honest education none of your modern trumpery quite right said mister power no superfluities said mister fogarty he enunciated the word and then drank gravely i remember reading said mister cunningham that one of pope leo's poems was on the invention of the photograph in latin of course on the photograph exclaimed mister kernan yes said mister cunningham he also drank from his glass well you know said mister m'coy isn't the photograph wonderful when you come to think of it o of course said mister power great minds can see things as the poet says great minds are very near to madness said mister fogarty great minds are very near to madness mister kernan seemed to be troubled in mind he made an effort to recall the protestant theology on some thorny points and in the end addressed mister cunningham tell me martin he said weren't some of the popes of course not our present man or his predecessor but some of the old popes not exactly you know up to the knocker there was a silence mister cunningham said o of course there were some bad lots but the astonishing thing is this not one of them not the biggest drunkard not the most out-and-out ruffian not one of them ever preached ex cathedra a word of false doctrine now isn't that an astonishing thing ex cathedra that is said mister kernan yes because when the pope speaks ex cathedra mister fogarty explained he is infallible ex cathedra yes said mister cunningham o i know about the infallibility of the pope i remember i was younger then or was it that mister fogarty interrupted he took up the bottle and helped the others to a little more mister m'coy seeing that there was not enough to go round pleaded that he had not finished his first measure the others accepted under protest the light music of whisky falling into glasses made an agreeable interlude what's that you were saying tom asked mister m'coy papal infallibility said mister cunningham that was the greatest scene in the whole history of the church how was that martin asked mister power mister cunningham held up two thick fingers in the sacred college you know of cardinals and archbishops and bishops there were two men who held out against it while the others were all for it the whole conclave except these two was unanimous no they wouldn't have it ha said mister m'coy and they were a german cardinal by the name of dolling or dowling or dowling was no german and that's a sure five said mister power laughing well this great german cardinal whatever his name was was one and the other was john machale what cried mister kernan is it john of tuam are you sure of that now asked mister fogarty dubiously i thought it was some italian or american john of tuam repeated mister cunningham was the man he drank and the other gentlemen followed his lead then he resumed there they were at it all the cardinals and bishops and archbishops from all the ends of the earth and these two fighting dog and devil until at last the pope himself stood up and declared infallibility a dogma of the church ex cathedra on the very moment john machale who had been arguing and arguing against it stood up and shouted out with the voice of a lion credo ex cathedra credo i believe said mister fogarty i believe credo said mister cunningham that showed the faith he had he submitted the moment the pope spoke credo and what about dowling asked mister m'coy the german cardinal wouldn't submit he left the church mister cunningham's words had built up the vast image of the church in the minds of his hearers his deep raucous voice had thrilled them as it uttered the word of belief and submission when missus kernan came into the room drying her hands she came into a solemn company she did not disturb the silence but leaned over the rail at the foot of the bed i once saw john machale said mister kernan and i'll never forget it as long as i live he turned towards his wife to be confirmed i often told you that missus kernan nodded it was at the unveiling of sir john gray's statue edmund dwyer gray was speaking blathering away and here was this old fellow crabbed-looking old chap looking at him from under his bushy eyebrows mister kernan knitted his brows and lowering his head like an angry bull glared at his wife god he exclaimed resuming his natural face i never saw such an eye in a man's head it was as much as to say i have you properly taped my lad he had an eye like a hawk i have you properly taped my lad none of the grays was any good said mister power there was a pause again mister power turned to missus kernan and said with abrupt joviality well missus kernan we're going to make your man here a good holy pious and god-fearing roman catholic he swept his arm round the company inclusively we're all going to make a retreat together and confess our sins and god knows we want it badly i don't mind said mister kernan smiling a little nervously missus kernan thought it would be wiser to conceal her satisfaction so she said i pity the poor priest that has to listen to your tale mister kernan's expression changed if he doesn't like it he said bluntly he can do the other thing i'll just tell him my little tale of woe i'm not such a bad fellow mister cunningham intervened promptly we'll all renounce the devil he said together not forgetting his works and pomps get behind me satan said mister fogarty laughing and looking at the others mister power said nothing he felt completely out-generalled but a pleased expression flickered across his face all we have to do said mister cunningham is to stand up with lighted candles in our hands and renew our baptismal vows o don't forget the candle tom said mister m'coy whatever you do what said mister kernan must i have a candle o yes said mister cunningham no damn it all said mister kernan sensibly i draw the line there i'll do the job right enough i'll do the retreat business and confession and all that business but no candles no damn it all i bar the candles he shook his head with farcical gravity listen to that said his wife i bar the candles said mister kernan conscious of having created an effect on his audience and continuing to shake his head to and fro i bar the magic-lantern business everyone laughed heartily there's a nice catholic for you said his wife no candles repeated mister kernan obdurately that's off the transept of the jesuit church in gardiner street was almost full and still at every moment gentlemen entered from the side door and directed by the lay-brother walked on tiptoe along the aisles until they found seating accommodation the gentlemen were all well dressed and orderly the light of the lamps of the church fell upon an assembly of black clothes and white collars relieved here and there by tweeds on dark mottled pillars of green marble and on lugubrious canvases the gentlemen sat in the benches having hitched their trousers slightly above their knees and laid their hats in security they sat well back and gazed formally at the distant speck of red light which was suspended before the high altar in one of the benches near the pulpit sat mister cunningham and mister kernan in the bench behind sat mister m'coy alone and in the bench behind him sat mister power and mister fogarty mister m'coy had tried unsuccessfully to find a place in the bench with the others and when the party had settled down in the form of a quincunx he had tried unsuccessfully to make comic remarks as these had not been well received he had desisted even he was sensible of the decorous atmosphere and even he began to respond to the religious stimulus in a whisper mister cunningham drew mister kernan's attention to mister harford the moneylender who sat some distance off and to mister fanning the registration agent and mayor maker of the city who was sitting immediately under the pulpit beside one of the newly elected councillors of the ward to the right sat old michael grimes the owner of three pawnbroker's shops and dan hogan's nephew who was up for the job in the town clerk's office farther in front sat mister hendrick the chief reporter of the freeman's journal and poor o'carroll an old friend of mister kernan's who had been at one time a considerable commercial figure gradually as he recognised familiar faces mister kernan began to feel more at home his hat which had been rehabilitated by his wife rested upon his knees once or twice he pulled down his cuffs with one hand while he held the brim of his hat lightly but firmly with the other hand the freeman's journal a powerful-looking figure the upper part of which was draped with a white surplice was observed to be struggling up into the pulpit simultaneously the congregation unsettled produced handkerchiefs and knelt upon them with care mister kernan followed the general example the priest's figure now stood upright in the pulpit two-thirds of its bulk crowned by a massive red face appearing above the balustrade father purdon knelt down turned towards the red speck of light and covering his face with his hands prayed after an interval he uncovered his face and rose the congregation rose also and settled again on its benches mister kernan restored his hat to its original position on his knee and presented an attentive face to the preacher the preacher turned back each wide sleeve of his surplice with an elaborate large gesture and slowly surveyed the array of faces then he said for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light wherefore make unto yourselves friends out of the mammon of iniquity so that when you die they may receive you into everlasting dwellings for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light wherefore make unto yourselves friends out of the mammon of iniquity so that when you die they may receive you into everlasting dwellings father purdon developed the text with resonant assurance it was one of the most difficult texts in all the scriptures he said to interpret properly it was a text which might seem to the casual observer at variance with the lofty morality elsewhere preached by jesus christ but he told his hearers the text had seemed to him specially adapted for the guidance of those whose lot it was to lead the life of the world and who yet wished to lead that life not in the manner of worldlings it was a text for business men and professional men jesus christ with his divine understanding of every cranny of our human nature understood that all men were not called to the religious life that by far the vast majority were forced to live in the world and to a certain extent for the world and in this sentence he designed to give them a word of counsel setting before them as exemplars in the religious life those very worshippers of mammon who were of all men the least solicitous in matters religious he told his hearers that he was there that evening for no terrifying no extravagant purpose but as a man of the world speaking to his fellow-men he came to speak to business men and he would speak to them in a businesslike way if he might use the metaphor he said he was their spiritual accountant and he wished each and every one of his hearers to open his books the books of his spiritual life and see if they tallied accurately with conscience jesus christ was not a hard taskmaster he understood our little failings understood the weakness of our poor fallen nature understood the temptations of this life we might have had we all had from time to time our temptations we might have we all had our failings but one thing only he said he would ask of his hearers and that was to be straight and manly with god if their accounts tallied in every point to say well i have verified my accounts i find all well but if as might happen there were some discrepancies to admit the truth to be frank and say like a man well i have looked into my accounts i find this wrong and this wrong but with god's grace i will rectify this and this i will set right my accounts
