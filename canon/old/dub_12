old jack raked the cinders together with a piece of cardboard and spread them judiciously over the whitening dome of coals when the dome was thinly covered his face lapsed into darkness but as he set himself to fan the fire again his crouching shadow ascended the opposite wall and his face slowly re-emerged into light it was an old man's face very bony and hairy the moist blue eyes blinked at the fire and the moist mouth fell open at times munching once or twice mechanically when it closed when the cinders had caught he laid the piece of cardboard against the wall sighed and said that's better now mister o'connor mister o'connor a grey-haired young man whose face was disfigured by many blotches and pimples had just brought the tobacco for a cigarette into a shapely cylinder but when spoken to he undid his handiwork meditatively then he began to roll the tobacco again meditatively and after a moment's thought decided to lick the paper did mister tierney say when he'd be back he asked in a husky falsetto he didn't say mister o'connor put his cigarette into his mouth and began to search his pockets he took out a pack of thin pasteboard cards i'll get you a match said the old man never mind this'll do said mister o'connor he selected one of the cards and read what was printed on it municipal elections royal exchange ward mister richard j tierney p l g respectfully solicits the favour of your vote and influence at the coming election in the royal exchange ward mister o'connor had been engaged by tierney's agent to canvass one part of the ward but as the weather was inclement and his boots let in the wet he spent a great part of the day sitting by the fire in the committee room in wicklow street with jack the old caretaker they had been sitting thus since the short day had grown dark it was the sixth of october dismal and cold out of doors mister o'connor tore a strip off the card and lighting it lit his cigarette as he did so the flame lit up a leaf of dark glossy ivy in the lapel of his coat the old man watched him attentively and then taking up the piece of cardboard again began to fan the fire slowly while his companion smoked ah yes he said continuing it's hard to know what way to bring up children now who'd think he'd turn out like that i sent him to the christian brothers and i done what i could for him and there he goes boosing about i tried to make him someway decent he replaced the cardboard wearily only i'm an old man now i'd change his tune for him i'd take the stick to his back and beat him while i could stand over him as i done many a time before the mother you know she cocks him up with this and that that's what ruins children said mister o'connor to be sure it is said the old man and little thanks you get for it only impudence he takes th'upper hand of me whenever he sees i've a sup taken what's the world coming to when sons speaks that way to their father what age is he said mister o'connor nineteen said the old man why don't you put him to something sure amn't i never done at the drunken bowsy ever since he left school i won't keep you i says you must get a job for yourself but sure it's worse whenever he gets a job he drinks it all mister o'connor shook his head in sympathy and the old man fell silent gazing into the fire someone opened the door of the room and called out hello is this a freemasons meeting who's that said the old man what are you doing in the dark asked a voice is that you hynes asked mister o'connor yes what are you doing in the dark said mister hynes advancing into the light of the fire he was a tall slender young man with a light brown moustache imminent little drops of rain hung at the brim of his hat and the collar of his jacket-coat was turned up well mat he said to mister o'connor how goes it mister o'connor shook his head the old man left the hearth and after stumbling about the room returned with two candlesticks which he thrust one after the other into the fire and carried to the table a denuded room came into view and the fire lost all its cheerful colour the walls of the room were bare except for a copy of an election address in the middle of the room was a small table on which papers were heaped mister hynes leaned against the mantelpiece and asked has he paid you yet not yet said mister o'connor i hope to god he'll not leave us in the lurch tonight mister hynes laughed o he'll pay you never fear he said i hope he'll look smart about it if he means business said mister o'connor what do you think jack said mister hynes satirically to the old man the old man returned to his seat by the fire saying it isn't but he has it anyway not like the other tinker what other tinker said mister hynes colgan said the old man scornfully it is because colgan's a working-man you say that what's the difference between a good honest bricklayer and a publican eh hasn't the working-man as good a right to be in the corporation as anyone else ay and a better right than those shoneens that are always hat in hand before any fellow with a handle to his name isn't that so mat said mister hynes addressing mister o'connor i think you're right said mister o'connor one man is a plain honest man with no hunker-sliding about him he goes in to represent the labour classes this fellow you're working for only wants to get some job or other of course the working-classes should be represented said the old man the working-man said mister hynes gets all kicks and no halfpence but it's labour produces everything the working-man is not looking for fat jobs for his sons and nephews and cousins the working-man is not going to drag the honour of dublin in the mud to please a german monarch how's that said the old man don't you know they want to present an address of welcome to edward rex if he comes here next year what do we want kowtowing to a foreign king our man won't vote for the address said mister o'connor he goes in on the nationalist ticket won't he said mister hynes wait till you see whether he will or not i know him is it tricky dicky tierney by god perhaps you're right joe said mister o'connor anyway i wish he'd turn up with the spondulics the three men fell silent the old man began to rake more cinders together mister hynes took off his hat shook it and then turned down the collar of his coat displaying as he did so an ivy leaf in the lapel if this man was alive he said pointing to the leaf we'd have no talk of an address of welcome that's true said mister o'connor musha god be with them times said the old man there was some life in it then the room was silent again then a bustling little man with a snuffling nose and very cold ears pushed in the door he walked over quickly to the fire rubbing his hands as if he intended to produce a spark from them no money boys he said sit down here mister henchy said the old man offering him his chair o don't stir jack don't stir said mister henchy he nodded curtly to mister hynes and sat down on the chair which the old man vacated did you serve aungier street he asked mister o'connor yes said mister o'connor beginning to search his pockets for memoranda did you call on grimes i did well how does he stand he wouldn't promise he said i won't tell anyone what way i'm going to vote but i think he'll be all right why so he asked me who the nominators were and i told him i mentioned father burke's name i think it'll be all right mister henchy began to snuffle and to rub his hands over the fire at a terrific speed then he said for the love of god jack bring us a bit of coal there must be some left the old man went out of the room it's no go said mister henchy shaking his head i asked the little shoeboy but he said oh now mister henchy when i see the work going on properly i won't forget you you may be sure mean little tinker 'usha how could he be anything else what did i tell you mat said mister hynes tricky dicky tierney o he's as tricky as they make 'em said mister henchy he hasn't got those little pigs eyes for nothing blast his soul couldn't he pay up like a man instead of o now mister henchy i must speak to mister fanning i've spent a lot of money' mean little shoeboy of hell i suppose he forgets the time his little old father kept the hand-me-down shop in mary's lane but is that a fact asked mister o'connor god yes said mister henchy did you never hear that and the men used to go in on sunday morning before the houses were open to buy a waistcoat or a trousers moya but tricky dicky's little old father always had a tricky little black bottle up in a corner do you mind now that's that that's where he first saw the light the old man returned with a few lumps of coal which he placed here and there on the fire that's a nice how-do-you-do said mister o'connor how does he expect us to work for him if he won't stump up i can't help it said mister henchy i expect to find the bailiffs in the hall when i go home mister hynes laughed and shoving himself away from the mantelpiece with the aid of his shoulders made ready to leave it'll be all right when king eddie comes he said well boys i'm off for the present see you later 'bye 'bye he went out of the room slowly neither mister henchy nor the old man said anything but just as the door was closing mister o'connor who had been staring moodily into the fire called out suddenly 'bye joe mister henchy waited a few moments and then nodded in the direction of the door tell me he said across the fire what brings our friend in here what does he want 'usha poor joe said mister o'connor throwing the end of his cigarette into the fire he's hard up like the rest of us mister henchy snuffled vigorously and spat so copiously that he nearly put out the fire which uttered a hissing protest to tell you my private and candid opinion he said i think he's a man from the other camp he's a spy of colgan's if you ask me just go round and try and find out how they're getting on they won't suspect you do you twig ah poor joe is a decent skin said mister o'connor his father was a decent respectable man mister henchy admitted poor old larry hynes many a good turn he did in his day but i'm greatly afraid our friend is not nineteen carat damn it i can understand a fellow being hard up but what i can't understand is a fellow sponging couldn't he have some spark of manhood about him he doesn't get a warm welcome from me when he comes said the old man let him work for his own side and not come spying around here i don't know said mister o'connor dubiously as he took out cigarette-papers and tobacco i think joe hynes is a straight man he's a clever chap too with the pen do you remember that thing he wrote some of these hillsiders and fenians are a bit too clever if you ask me said mister henchy do you know what my private and candid opinion is about some of those little jokers i believe half of them are in the pay of the castle there's no knowing said the old man o but i know it for a fact said mister henchy they're castle hacks i don't say hynes no damn it i think he's a stroke above that but there's a certain little nobleman with a cock-eye you know the patriot i'm alluding to mister o'connor nodded there's a lineal descendant of major sirr for you if you like o the heart's blood of a patriot that's a fellow now that'd sell his country for fourpence ay and go down on his bended knees and thank the almighty christ he had a country to sell there was a knock at the door come in said mister henchy a person resembling a poor clergyman or a poor actor appeared in the doorway his black clothes were tightly buttoned on his short body and it was impossible to say whether he wore a clergyman's collar or a layman's because the collar of his shabby frock-coat the uncovered buttons of which reflected the candlelight was turned up about his neck he wore a round hat of hard black felt his face shining with raindrops had the appearance of damp yellow cheese save where two rosy spots indicated the cheekbones he opened his very long mouth suddenly to express disappointment and at the same time opened wide his very bright blue eyes to express pleasure and surprise o father keon said mister henchy jumping up from his chair is that you come in o no no no said father keon quickly pursing his lips as if he were addressing a child won't you come in and sit down no no no said father keon speaking in a discreet indulgent velvety voice don't let me disturb you now i'm just looking for mister fanning he's round at the black eagle said mister henchy but won't you come in and sit down a minute black eagle no no thank you it was just a little business matter said father keon thank you indeed he retreated from the doorway and mister henchy seizing one of the candlesticks went to the door to light him downstairs o don't trouble i beg no but the stairs is so dark no no i can see thank you indeed are you right now all right thanks thanks mister henchy returned with the candlestick and put it on the table he sat down again at the fire there was silence for a few moments tell me john said mister o'connor lighting his cigarette with another pasteboard card hm what he is exactly ask me an easier one said mister henchy fanning and himself seem to me very thick they're often in kavanagh's together is he a priest at all mmmyes i believe so i think he's what you call a black sheep we haven't many of them thank god but we have a few he's an unfortunate man of some kind and how does he knock it out asked mister o'connor that's another mystery is he attached to any chapel or church or institution or no said mister henchy i think he's travelling on his own account god forgive me he added i thought he was the dozen of stout is there any chance of a drink itself asked mister o'connor i'm dry too said the old man i asked that little shoeboy three times said mister henchy would he send up a dozen of stout i asked him again now but he was leaning on the counter in his shirt-sleeves having a deep goster with alderman cowley why didn't you remind him said mister o'connor well i couldn't go over while he was talking to alderman cowley i just waited till i caught his eye and said about that little matter i was speaking to you about that'll be all right mister h he said yerra sure the little hop-o'-my-thumb has forgotten all about it there's some deal on in that quarter said mister o'connor thoughtfully i saw the three of them hard at it yesterday at suffolk street corner i think i know the little game they're at said mister henchy you must owe the city fathers money nowadays if you want to be made lord mayor then they'll make you lord mayor by god i'm thinking seriously of becoming a city father myself what do you think would i do for the job mister o'connor laughed so far as owing money goes doctoriving out of the mansion house said mister henchy in all my vermin with jack here standing up behind me in a powdered wig eh and make me your private secretary john yes and i'll make father keon my private chaplain we'll have a family party faith mister henchy said the old man you'd keep up better style than some of them i was talking one day to old keegan the porter and how do you like your new master pat says i to him you haven't much entertaining now says i entertaining says he he'd live on the smell of an oil-rag and do you know what he told me now i declare to god i didn't believe him what said mister henchy and mister o'connor he told me what do you think of a lord mayor of dublin sending out for a pound of chops for his dinner how's that for high living says he wisha wisha says i a pound of chops says he coming into the mansion house ' wisha says i what kind of people is going at all now at this point there was a knock at the door and a boy put in his head what is it said the old man from the black eagle said the boy walking in sideways and depositing a basket on the floor with a noise of shaken bottles black eagle the old man helped the boy to transfer the bottles from the basket to the table and counted the full tally after the transfer the boy put his basket on his arm and asked any bottles what bottles said the old man won't you let us drink them first said mister henchy i was told to ask for the bottles come back tomorrow said the old man here boy said mister henchy will you run over to o'farrell's and ask him to lend us a corkscrew for mister henchy say tell him we won't keep it a minute leave the basket there the boy went out and mister henchy began to rub his hands cheerfully saying ah well he's not so bad after all he's as good as his word anyhow there's no tumblers said the old man o don't let that trouble you jack said mister henchy many's the good man before now drank out of the bottle anyway it's better than nothing said mister o'connor he's not a bad sort said mister henchy only fanning has such a loan of him he means well you know in his own tinpot way the boy came back with the corkscrew the old man opened three bottles and was handing back the corkscrew when mister henchy said to the boy would you like a drink boy if you please sir said the boy the old man opened another bottle grudgingly and handed it to the boy what age are you he asked seventeen said the boy as the old man said nothing further the boy took the bottle and said here's my best respects sir to mister henchy drank the contents put the bottle back on the table and wiped his mouth with his sleeve then he took up the corkscrew and went out of the door sideways muttering some form of salutation that's the way it begins said the old man the thin edge of the wedge said mister henchy the old man distributed the three bottles which he had opened and the men drank from them simultaneously after having drunk each placed his bottle on the mantelpiece within hand's reach and drew in a long breath of satisfaction well i did a good day's work today said mister henchy after a pause that so john yes i got him one or two sure things in dawson street crofton and myself between ourselves you know crofton he's a decent chap of course but he's not worth a damn as a canvasser he hasn't a word to throw to a dog he stands and looks at the people while i do the talking here two men entered the room one of them was a very fat man whose blue serge clothes seemed to be in danger of falling from his sloping figure he had a big face which resembled a young ox's face in expression staring blue eyes and a grizzled moustache the other man who was much younger and frailer had a thin clean-shaven face he wore a very high double collar and a wide-brimmed bowler hat hello crofton said mister henchy to the fat man talk of the devil where did the boose come from asked the young man did the cow calve o of course lyons spots the drink first thing said mister o'connor laughing is that the way you chaps canvass said mister lyons and crofton and i out in the cold and rain looking for votes why blast your soul said mister henchy i'd get more votes in five minutes than you two'd get in a week open two bottles of stout jack said mister o'connor how can i said the old man when there's no corkscrew wait now wait now said mister henchy getting up quickly did you ever see this little trick he took two bottles from the table and carrying them to the fire put them on the hob then he sat down again by the fire and took another drink from his bottle mister lyons sat on the edge of the table pushed his hat towards the nape of his neck and began to swing his legs which is my bottle he asked this lad said mister henchy mister crofton sat down on a box and looked fixedly at the other bottle on the hob he was silent for two reasons the first reason sufficient in itself was that he had nothing to say the second reason was that he considered his companions beneath him he had been a canvasser for wilkins the conservative but when the conservatives had withdrawn their man and choosing the lesser of two evils given their support to the nationalist candidate he had been engaged to work for mister tierney in a few minutes an apologetic pok was heard as the cork flew out of mister lyons bottle mister lyons jumped off the table went to the fire took his bottle and carried it back to the table i was just telling them crofton said mister henchy that we got a good few votes today who did you get asked mister lyons well i got parkes for one and i got atkinson for two and got ward of dawson street fine old chap he is too regular old toff old conservative but isn't your candidate a nationalist said he he's a respectable man said i he's in favour of whatever will benefit this country he's a big ratepayer i said he has extensive house property in the city and three places of business and isn't it to his own advantage to keep down the rates he's a prominent and respected citizen said i and a poor law guardian and he doesn't belong to any party good bad or indifferent that's the way to talk to 'em and what about the address to the king said mister lyons after drinking and smacking his lips listen to me said mister henchy what we want in this country as i said to old ward is capital the king's coming here will mean an influx of money into this country the citizens of dublin will benefit by it look at all the factories down by the quays there idle look at all the money there is in the country if we only worked the old industries the mills the ship-building yards and factories it's capital we want but look here john said mister o'connor why should we welcome the king of england didn't parnell himself parnell said mister henchy is dead now here's the way i look at it here's this chap come to the throne after his old mother keeping him out of it till the man was grey he's a man of the world and he means well by us he's a jolly fine decent fellow if you ask me and no damn nonsense about him he just says to himself the old one never went to see these wild irish by christ i'll go myself and see what they're like and are we going to insult the man when he comes over here on a friendly visit eh isn't that right crofton mister crofton nodded his head but after all now said mister lyons argumentatively king edward's life you know is not the very let bygones be bygones said mister henchy i admire the man personally he's just an ordinary knockabout like you and me he's fond of his glass of grog and he's a bit of a rake perhaps and he's a good sportsman damn it can't we irish play fair that's all very fine said mister lyons but look at the case of parnell now in the name of god said mister henchy where's the analogy between the two cases what i mean said mister lyons is we have our ideals why now would we welcome a man like that do you think now after what he did parnell was a fit man to lead us and why then would we do it for edward the seventh this is parnell's anniversary said mister o'connor and don't let us stir up any bad blood we all respect him now that he's dead and gone even the conservatives he added turning to mister crofton pok the tardy cork flew out of mister crofton's bottle mister crofton got up from his box and went to the fire as he returned with his capture he said in a deep voice our side of the house respects him because he was a gentleman right you are crofton said mister henchy fiercely he was the only man that could keep that bag of cats in order down ye dogs lie down ye curs that's the way he treated them come in joe come in he called out catching sight of mister hynes in the doorway mister hynes came in slowly open another bottle of stout jack said mister henchy o i forgot there's no corkscrew here show me one here and i'll put it at the fire the old man handed him another bottle and he placed it on the hob sit down joe said mister o'connor we're just talking about the chief ay ay said mister henchy mister hynes sat on the side of the table near mister lyons but said nothing there's one of them anyhow said mister henchy that didn't renege him by god i'll say for you joe no by god you stuck to him like a man o joe said mister o'connor suddenly give us that thing you wrote do you remember have you got it on you o ay said mister henchy give us that did you ever hear that crofton listen to this now splendid thing go on said mister o'connor fire away joe mister hynes did not seem to remember at once the piece to which they were alluding but after reflecting a while he said o that thing is it sure that's old now out with it man said mister o'connor 'sh 'sh said mister henchy now joe mister hynes hesitated a little longer then amid the silence he took off his hat laid it on the table and stood up he seemed to be rehearsing the piece in his mind after a rather long pause he announced the death of parnell sixth october eighteen ninety one th october he cleared his throat once or twice and then began to recite he is dead our uncrowned king is dead o erin mourn with grief and woe for he lies dead whom the fell gang of modern hypocrites laid low he lies slain by the coward hounds he raised to glory from the mire and erin's hopes and erin's dreams perish upon her monarch's pyre in palace cabin or in cot the irish heart where'er it be is bowed with woe for he is gone who would have wrought her destiny he would have had his erin famed the green flag gloriously unfurled her statesmen bards and warriors raised before the nations of the world he dreamed alas 'twas but a dream of liberty but as he strove to clutch that idol treachery sundered him from the thing he loved shame on the coward caitiff hands that smote their lord or with a kiss betrayed him to the rabble-rout of fawning priests no friends of his may everlasting shame consume the memory of those who tried to befoul and smear the exalted name of one who spurned them in his pride he fell as fall the mighty ones nobly undaunted to the last and death has now united him with erin's heroes of the past no sound of strife disturb his sleep calmly he rests no human pain or high ambition spurs him now the peaks of glory to attain they had their way they laid him low but erin list his spirit may rise like the phÅ“nix from the flames when breaks the dawning of the day the day that brings us freedom's reign and on that day may erin well pledge in the cup she lifts to joy one grief the memory of parnell mister hynes sat down again on the table when he had finished his recitation there was a silence and then a burst of clapping even mister lyons clapped the applause continued for a little time when it had ceased all the auditors drank from their bottles in silence pok the cork flew out of mister hynes bottle but mister hynes remained sitting flushed and bareheaded on the table he did not seem to have heard the invitation good man joe said mister o'connor taking out his cigarette papers and pouch the better to hide his emotion what do you think of that crofton cried mister henchy isn't that fine what mister crofton said that it was a very fine piece of writing
