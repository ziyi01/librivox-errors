mister holohan assistant secretary of the eire abu society had been walking up and down dublin for nearly a month with his hands and pockets full of dirty pieces of paper arranging about the series of concerts he had a game leg and for this his friends called him hoppy holohan he walked up and down constantly stood by the hour at street corners arguing the point and made notes but in the end it was missus kearney who arranged everything eire abu miss devlin had become missus kearney out of spite she had been educated in a high-class convent where she had learned french and music as she was naturally pale and unbending in manner she made few friends at school when she came to the age of marriage she was sent out to many houses where her playing and ivory manners were much admired she sat amid the chilly circle of her accomplishments waiting for some suitor to brave it and offer her a brilliant life but the young men whom she met were ordinary and she gave them no encouragement trying to console her romantic desires by eating a great deal of turkish delight in secret however when she drew near the limit and her friends began to loosen their tongues about her she silenced them by marrying mister kearney who was a bootmaker on ormond quay he was much older than she his conversation which was serious took place at intervals in his great brown beard after the first year of married life missus kearney perceived that such a man would wear better than a romantic person but she never put her own romantic ideas away he was sober thrifty and pious he went to the altar every first friday sometimes with her oftener by himself but she never weakened in her religion and was a good wife to him at some party in a strange house when she lifted her eyebrow ever so slightly he stood up to take his leave and when his cough troubled him she put the eider-down quilt over his feet and made a strong rum punch for his part he was a model father by paying a small sum every week into a society he ensured for both his daughters a dowry of one hundred pounds each when they came to the age of twenty-four he sent the elder daughter kathleen to a good convent where she learned french and music and afterward paid her fees at the academy every year in the month of july missus kearney found occasion to say to some friend my good man is packing us off to skerries for a few weeks if it was not skerries it was howth or greystones when the irish revival began to be appreciable missus kearney determined to take advantage of her daughter's name and brought an irish teacher to the house kathleen and her sister sent irish picture postcards to their friends and these friends sent back other irish picture postcards on special sundays when mister kearney went with his family to the pro-cathedral a little crowd of people would assemble after mass at the corner of cathedral street they were all friends of the kearneys musical friends or nationalist friends and when they had played every little counter of gossip they shook hands with one another all together laughing at the crossing of so many hands and said good-bye to one another in irish soon the name of miss kathleen kearney began to be heard often on people's lips people said that she was very clever at music and a very nice girl and moreover that she was a believer in the language movement missus kearney was well content at this therefore she was not surprised when one day mister holohan came to her and proposed that her daughter should be the accompanist at a series of four grand concerts which his society was going to give in the antient concert rooms she brought him into the drawing-room made him sit down and brought out the decanter and the silver biscuit-barrel she entered heart and soul into the details of the enterprise advised and dissuaded and finally a contract was drawn up by which kathleen was to receive eight guineas for her services as accompanist at the four grand concerts as mister holohan was a novice in such delicate matters as the wording of bills and the disposing of items for a programme missus kearney helped him she had tact she knew what artistes should go into capitals and what artistes should go into small type she knew that the first tenor would not like to come on after mister meade's comic turn to keep the audience continually diverted she slipped the doubtful items in between the old favourites mister holohan called to see her every day to have her advice on some point she was invariably friendly and advising homely in fact she pushed the decanter towards him saying artistes artistes now help yourself mister holohan and while he was helping himself she said don't be afraid don't be afraid of it everything went on smoothly missus kearney bought some lovely blush-pink charmeuse in brown thomas's to let into the front of kathleen's dress it cost a pretty penny but there are occasions when a little expense is justifiable she took a dozen of two-shilling tickets for the final concert and sent them to those friends who could not be trusted to come otherwise she forgot nothing and thanks to her everything that was to be done was done the concerts were to be on wednesday thursday friday and saturday when missus kearney arrived with her daughter at the antient concert rooms on wednesday night she did not like the look of things a few young men wearing bright blue badges in their coats stood idle in the vestibule none of them wore evening dress she passed by with her daughter and a quick glance through the open door of the hall showed her the cause of the stewards idleness at first she wondered had she mistaken the hour no it was twenty minutes to eight in the dressing-room behind the stage she was introduced to the secretary of the society mister fitzpatrick she smiled and shook his hand he was a little man with a white vacant face she noticed that he wore his soft brown hat carelessly on the side of his head and that his accent was flat he held a programme in his hand and while he was talking to her he chewed one end of it into a moist pulp he seemed to bear disappointments lightly mister holohan came into the dressing-room every few minutes with reports from the box-office the artistes talked among themselves nervously glanced from time to time at the mirror and rolled and unrolled their music when it was nearly half-past eight the few people in the hall began to express their desire to be entertained mister fitzpatrick came in smiled vacantly at the room and said artistes well now ladies and gentlemen i suppose we'd better open the ball missus kearney rewarded his very flat final syllable with a quick stare of contempt and then said to her daughter encouragingly are you ready dear when she had an opportunity she called mister holohan aside and asked him to tell her what it meant mister holohan did not know what it meant he said that the committee had made a mistake in arranging for four concerts four was too many and the artistes said missus kearney of course they are doing their best but really they are not good artistes mister holohan admitted that the artistes were no good but the committee he said had decided to let the first three concerts go as they pleased and reserve all the talent for saturday night missus kearney said nothing but as the mediocre items followed one another on the platform and the few people in the hall grew fewer and fewer she began to regret that she had put herself to any expense for such a concert there was something she didn't like in the look of things and mister fitzpatrick's vacant smile irritated her very much however she said nothing and waited to see how it would end the concert expired shortly before ten and everyone went home quickly artistes the concert on thursday night was better attended but missus kearney saw at once that the house was filled with paper the audience behaved indecorously as if the concert were an informal dress rehearsal mister fitzpatrick seemed to enjoy himself he was quite unconscious that missus kearney was taking angry note of his conduct he stood at the edge of the screen from time to time jutting out his head and exchanging a laugh with two friends in the corner of the balcony in the course of the evening missus kearney learned that the friday concert was to be abandoned and that the committee was going to move heaven and earth to secure a bumper house on saturday night when she heard this she sought out mister holohan she buttonholed him as he was limping out quickly with a glass of lemonade for a young lady and asked him was it true yes it was true but of course that doesn't alter the contract she said the contract was for four concerts mister holohan seemed to be in a hurry he advised her to speak to mister fitzpatrick missus kearney was now beginning to be alarmed she called mister fitzpatrick away from his screen and told him that her daughter had signed for four concerts and that of course according to the terms of the contract she should receive the sum originally stipulated for whether the society gave the four concerts or not mister fitzpatrick who did not catch the point at issue very quickly seemed unable to resolve the difficulty and said that he would bring the matter before the committee missus kearney's anger began to flutter in her cheek and she had all she could do to keep from asking and who is the cometty pray cometty but she knew that it would not be ladylike to do that so she was silent little boys were sent out into the principal streets of dublin early on friday morning with bundles of handbills special puffs appeared in all the evening papers reminding the music-loving public of the treat which was in store for it on the following evening missus kearney was somewhat reassured but she thought well to tell her husband part of her suspicions he listened carefully and said that perhaps it would be better if he went with her on saturday night she agreed she respected her husband in the same way as she respected the general post office as something large secure and fixed and though she knew the small number of his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male she was glad that he had suggested coming with her she thought her plans over the night of the grand concert came missus kearney with her husband and daughter arrived at the antient concert rooms three-quarters of an hour before the time at which the concert was to begin by ill luck it was a rainy evening missus kearney placed her daughter's clothes and music in charge of her husband and went all over the building looking for mister holohan or mister fitzpatrick she could find neither she asked the stewards was any member of the committee in the hall and after a great deal of trouble a steward brought out a little woman named miss beirne to whom missus kearney explained that she wanted to see one of the secretaries miss beirne expected them any minute and asked could she do anything missus kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face which was screwed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and answered no thank you the little woman hoped they would have a good house she looked out at the rain until the melancholy of the wet street effaced all the trustfulness and enthusiasm from her twisted features then she gave a little sigh and said ah well we did our best the dear knows missus kearney had to go back to the dressing-room the artistes were arriving the bass and the second tenor had already come the bass mister duggan was a slender young man with a scattered black moustache he was the son of a hall porter in an office in the city and as a boy he had sung prolonged bass notes in the resounding hall from this humble state he had raised himself until he had become a first-rate artiste he had appeared in grand opera one night when an operatic artiste had fallen ill he had undertaken the part of the king in the opera of maritana at the queen's theatre he sang his music with great feeling and volume and was warmly welcomed by the gallery but unfortunately he marred the good impression by wiping his nose in his gloved hand once or twice out of thoughtlessness he was unassuming and spoke little he said yous so softly that it passed unnoticed and he never drank anything stronger than milk for his voice's sake mister bell the second tenor was a fair-haired little man who competed every year for prizes at the feis ceoil on his fourth trial he had been awarded a bronze medal he was extremely nervous and extremely jealous of other tenors and he covered his nervous jealousy with an ebullient friendliness it was his humour to have people know what an ordeal a concert was to him therefore when he saw mister duggan he went over to him and asked artistes artiste artiste maritana yous are you in it too yes said mister duggan mister bell laughed at his fellow-sufferer held out his hand and said shake missus kearney passed by these two young men and went to the edge of the screen to view the house the seats were being filled up rapidly and a pleasant noise circulated in the auditorium she came back and spoke to her husband privately their conversation was evidently about kathleen for they both glanced at her often as she stood chatting to one of her nationalist friends miss healy the contralto an unknown solitary woman with a pale face walked through the room the women followed with keen eyes the faded blue dress which was stretched upon a meagre body someone said that she was madam glynn the soprano i wonder where did they dig her up said kathleen to miss healy i'm sure i never heard of her miss healy had to smile mister holohan limped into the dressing-room at that moment and the two young ladies asked him who was the unknown woman mister holohan said that she was madam glynn from london madam glynn took her stand in a corner of the room holding a roll of music stiffly before her and from time to time changing the direction of her startled gaze the shadow took her faded dress into shelter but fell revengefully into the little cup behind her collar-bone the noise of the hall became more audible the first tenor and the baritone arrived together they were both well dressed stout and complacent and they brought a breath of opulence among the company missus kearney brought her daughter over to them and talked to them amiably she wanted to be on good terms with them but while she strove to be polite her eyes followed mister holohan in his limping and devious courses as soon as she could she excused herself and went out after him mister holohan i want to speak to you for a moment she said they went down to a discreet part of the corridor missus kearney asked him when was her daughter going to be paid mister holohan said that mister fitzpatrick had charge of that missus kearney said that she didn't know anything about mister fitzpatrick her daughter had signed a contract for eight guineas and she would have to be paid mister holohan said that it wasn't his business why isn't it your business asked missus kearney didn't you yourself bring her the contract anyway if it's not your business it's my business and i mean to see to it you'd better speak to mister fitzpatrick said mister holohan distantly i don't know anything about mister fitzpatrick repeated missus kearney i have my contract and i intend to see that it is carried out when she came back to the dressing-room her cheeks were slightly suffused the room was lively two men in outdoor dress had taken possession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with miss healy and the baritone they were the freeman man and mister o'madden burke the freeman man had come in to say that he could not wait for the concert as he had to report the lecture which an american priest was giving in the mansion house he said they were to leave the report for him at the freeman office and he would see that it went in he was a grey-haired man with a plausible voice and careful manners he held an extinguished cigar in his hand and the aroma of cigar smoke floated near him he had not intended to stay a moment because concerts and artistes bored him considerably but he remained leaning against the mantelpiece miss healy stood in front of him talking and laughing he was old enough to suspect one reason for her politeness but young enough in spirit to turn the moment to account the warmth fragrance and colour of her body appealed to his senses he was pleasantly conscious that the bosom which he saw rise and fall slowly beneath him rose and fell at that moment for him that the laughter and fragrance and wilful glances were his tribute when he could stay no longer he took leave of her regretfully freeman freeman freeman artistes o'madden burke will write the notice he explained to mister holohan and i'll see it in thank you very much mister hendrick said mister holohan you'll see it in i know now won't you have a little something before you go i don't mind said mister hendrick the two men went along some tortuous passages and up a dark staircase and came to a secluded room where one of the stewards was uncorking bottles for a few gentlemen one of these gentlemen was mister o'madden burke who had found out the room by instinct he was a suave elderly man who balanced his imposing body when at rest upon a large silk umbrella his magniloquent western name was the moral umbrella upon which he balanced the fine problem of his finances he was widely respected while mister holohan was entertaining the freeman man missus kearney was speaking so animatedly to her husband that he had to ask her to lower her voice the conversation of the others in the dressing-room had become strained mister bell the first item stood ready with his music but the accompanist made no sign evidently something was wrong mister kearney looked straight before him stroking his beard while missus kearney spoke into kathleen's ear with subdued emphasis from the hall came sounds of encouragement clapping and stamping of feet the first tenor and the baritone and miss healy stood together waiting tranquilly but mister bell's nerves were greatly agitated because he was afraid the audience would think that he had come late freeman mister holohan and mister o'madden burke came into the room in a moment mister holohan perceived the hush he went over to missus kearney and spoke with her earnestly while they were speaking the noise in the hall grew louder mister holohan became very red and excited he spoke volubly but missus kearney said curtly at intervals she won't go on she must get her eight guineas mister holohan pointed desperately towards the hall where the audience was clapping and stamping he appealed to mister kearney and to kathleen but mister kearney continued to stroke his beard and kathleen looked down moving the point of her new shoe it was not her fault missus kearney repeated she won't go on without her money after a swift struggle of tongues mister holohan hobbled out in haste the room was silent when the strain of the silence had become somewhat painful miss healy said to the baritone have you seen missus pat campbell this week the baritone had not seen her but he had been told that she was very fine the conversation went no further the first tenor bent his head and began to count the links of the gold chain which was extended across his waist smiling and humming random notes to observe the effect on the frontal sinus from time to time everyone glanced at missus kearney the noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when mister fitzpatrick burst into the room followed by mister holohan who was panting the clapping and stamping in the hall were punctuated by whistling mister fitzpatrick held a few banknotes in his hand he counted out four into missus kearney's hand and said she would get the other half at the interval missus kearney said this is four shillings short but kathleen gathered in her skirt and said now mister bell to the first item who was shaking like an aspen the singer and the accompanist went out together the noise in hall died away there was a pause of a few seconds and then the piano was heard now mister bell the first part of the concert was very successful except for madam glynn's item the poor lady sang killarney in a bodiless gasping voice with all the old-fashioned mannerisms of intonation and pronunciation which she believed lent elegance to her singing she looked as if she had been resurrected from an old stage-wardrobe and the cheaper parts of the hall made fun of her high wailing notes the first tenor and the contralto however brought down the house kathleen played a selection of irish airs which was generously applauded the first part closed with a stirring patriotic recitation delivered by a young lady who arranged amateur theatricals it was deservedly applauded and when it was ended the men went out for the interval content killarney all this time the dressing-room was a hive of excitement in one corner were mister holohan mister fitzpatrick miss beirne two of the stewards the baritone the bass and mister o'madden burke mister o'madden burke said it was the most scandalous exhibition he had ever witnessed miss kathleen kearney's musical career was ended in dublin after that he said the baritone was asked what did he think of missus kearney's conduct he did not like to say anything he had been paid his money and wished to be at peace with men however he said that missus kearney might have taken the artistes into consideration the stewards and the secretaries debated hotly as to what should be done when the interval came artistes i agree with miss beirne said mister o'madden burke pay her nothing in another corner of the room were missus kearney and her husband mister bell miss healy and the young lady who had to recite the patriotic piece missus kearney said that the committee had treated her scandalously she had spared neither trouble nor expense and this was how she was repaid they thought they had only a girl to deal with and that therefore they could ride roughshod over her but she would show them their mistake they wouldn't have dared to have treated her like that if she had been a man but she would see that her daughter got her rights she wouldn't be fooled if they didn't pay her to the last farthing she would make dublin ring of course she was sorry for the sake of the artistes but what else could she do she appealed to the second tenor who said he thought she had not been well treated then she appealed to miss healy miss healy wanted to join the other group but she did not like to do so because she was a great friend of kathleen's and the kearneys had often invited her to their house artistes as soon as the first part was ended mister fitzpatrick and mister holohan went over to missus kearney and told her that the other four guineas would be paid after the committee meeting on the following tuesday and that in case her daughter did not play for the second part the committee would consider the contract broken and would pay nothing i haven't seen any committee said missus kearney angrily my daughter has her contract she will get four pounds eight into her hand or a foot she won't put on that platform i'm surprised at you missus kearney said mister holohan i never thought you would treat us this way and what way did you treat me asked missus kearney her face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she would attack someone with her hands i'm asking for my rights she said you might have some sense of decency said mister holohan might i indeed and when i ask when my daughter is going to be paid i can't get a civil answer she tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice you must speak to the secretary it's not my business i'm a great fellow fol-the-diddle-i-do i thought you were a lady said mister holohan walking away from her abruptly after that missus kearney's conduct was condemned on all hands everyone approved of what the committee had done she stood at the door haggard with rage arguing with her husband and daughter gesticulating with them she waited until it was time for the second part to begin in the hope that the secretaries would approach her but miss healy had kindly consented to play one or two accompaniments missus kearney had to stand aside to allow the baritone and his accompanist to pass up to the platform she stood still for an instant like an angry stone image and when the first notes of the song struck her ear she caught up her daughter's cloak and said to her husband get a cab he went out at once missus kearney wrapped the cloak round her daughter and followed him as she passed through the doorway she stopped and glared into mister holohan's face i'm not done with you yet she said but i'm done with you said mister holohan kathleen followed her mother meekly mister holohan began to pace up and down the room in order to cool himself for he felt his skin on fire that's a nice lady he said o she's a nice lady you did the proper thing holohan said mister o'madden burke poised upon his umbrella in approval
